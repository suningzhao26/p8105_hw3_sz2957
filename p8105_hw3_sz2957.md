### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows
    ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

### Problem 2

#### Read in the data, tidy and wrangle

-   The process begins with data import and updating variable names,
    using `read_csv` and `clean_names()`.
-   Then, I create a new variable called `weekdays` using `case_when()`
    to classify whether the days are in weekend or weekdays.
-   In the next step, I use `pivot_longer` to make it a longer table for
    accelerometer in different minutes, and then make `minutes` as
    numeric
-   Finally, I change the order of columns using `fct_level`,`select`
    and arrange the dataset using `arrange`.

``` r
Accel_df =
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekdays = case_when(
      day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday") ~ "Weekend",
      day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "Weekday",
      TRUE ~ "")
      )%>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minutes",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "accelerometer"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday","Saturday","Sunday"),
    minutes = as.numeric(minutes)
  ) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, weekdays, day, everything()) %>% 
  arrange(week, day)
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

-   In the dataset `Accel_df`, there are 50400 observations and 6
    variables.
-   The key variables’ names are week, day_id, weekdays, day, minutes,
    accelerometer.

#### Traditional analyses of accelerometer data

-   To analyze the accelerometer data focusing on the total activity
    over the day, I used `group_by()` and summarize()\` to generate a
    total activity for each day.
-   Then, I use `pivot_wider` to generate a wider table to make it
    clearer, and use `kable` in `knitr` to create the visualized table

``` r
Accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week,day) %>% 
  summarize(
    sum_accelerometer = sum(accelerometer, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "sum_accelerometer"
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
|-----:|----------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|
|    1 |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |   376254 | 631105 |
|    2 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |   607175 | 422018 |
|    3 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |   382928 | 467052 |
|    4 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |     1440 | 260617 |
|    5 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |     1440 | 138421 |

-   The result from the table seems that there is no apparent trends for
    total activity in each day.

#### Make a single-panel plot

-   For this question, I use `ggplot` to make x-axis as `minutes` and
    y-axis as `accelerometer` and use color to indicate the day of the
    week.

``` r
Accel_plot = 
  Accel_df %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = accelerometer, color = week)) +
  geom_line(alpha = .5) 

ggsave("./Results/weather_plot.pdf", Accel_plot, width = 8, height = 5)

Accel_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sz2957_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

-   From the graph we can know that:
    1.  Within one day, the patient is with low activity level in the
        first 250 minutes, and with a relatively higher activity from
        500 to 750 minute and from 1000 to 1250 minute.
    2.  For one patient, the activity level is relatively decreasing
        over time. In week 5, it can be seen that the activity level is
        lower than other four weeks except for 250 to 500 minute.
